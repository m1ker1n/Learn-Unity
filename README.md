 What need to do:
 - Hard: Game user interface

At the start of the game, display in the console that the player’s Lives = 3 and Score = 0. If the player feeds an animal, increase and display the Score. If the player misses an animal or is hit by one, decrease and display the Lives. When the number of Lives reaches 0, log “Game Over” in the console.
