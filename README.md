 What need to do:
 - Medium: Aggressive animals

 Have animals that also spawn from the left and right side of the screen. If one of them hits you, “Game Over” should be logged to the console.  
 This will make the game much more exciting and requires the player to stay on their toes, especially if vertical movement is also implemented.
